        The <strong>tarot </strong>(/ˈtæroʊ/, first known as <strong>trionfi</strong> and later as <strong>tarocchi</strong> or <strong> tarock</strong>) is a pack of playing cards,
        <br> used from at least the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian tarocchini,
        <br> French tarot and Austrian Königrufen, many of which are still played today.

        A Tarot deck consists of 78 cards. The first 22 cards are the <em>Major Arcana</em>.<br>
        These cards have symbolic meanings focused on the material world, the intuitive mind, and the realm of change. <br>
        The remaining 56 cards are the Minor Arcana, and are divided into four groups or suits: <em>Swords, Pentacles (or Coins), Wands and Cups.</em></p>

      <p align="center">
        Tarot cards are there to give guidance, and as shamans like to say, <strong>“medicine”</strong> around what is happening in your personal orbit:<br><em> love, money, career, goals, and general life path.</em>
        <br>How should someone interpret the cards they pull?
        <br>Every tarot deck comes with a guidebook to aid in interpretation.
        <br>Start by looking at each card in the deck and familiarizing yourself with the imagery and how the card makes you feel.You will form a relationship with the cards and, strangely enough, they with you.
        <br><strong title="Here big tag is used to make text big and q tag is used for quotations"><big><q> It is in our acceptance where we find freedom. </q></big></strong>
        <br>Everything comes down to energy and tarot is no different. The power of the mind is incredible, and when the mind takes a backseat to your intuition, you better get ready for some miracles!
        <br>The only rule in reading tarot is to have an open mind and listen with your heart, not your head.
