    <ol>
      <li>Take a few deep breaths holding your deck in your hands and meditate on sharpening your intuition and connecting with the cards</li>
      <li>Shuffle your deck while asking your question in your head and meditate on inviting the card that is best suited to come through</li>
      <li>You can either stop when you feel ready, count to a number, cut the deck, or feel it out for which card is raising it’s cosmic hand to answer you (sometimes they even jump out!!)</li>
      <li>If the card is upright, there is believed to be one interpretation, and if the card is reversed, or upside down, there is an opposite interpretation, usually to inspire growth and a shift.
        Not all tarot readers will read with the reversed meaning, so this is also up to you</li>
